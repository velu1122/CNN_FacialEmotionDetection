# Facial Emotion Recognition

Convolutional Neural Network based Facial Emotions Recognition.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5+ or Python 2.7 (it may work with other versions too)
* Windows (can be executed in Linux as well)
* Project created in Anaconda Spyder
* Tensorflow v1.13 or any v1 versions

## From source
Dataset can be placed at *SampleDataset* folder. Training can be started from **__init__.py** file.
And Inference can be done using **Inference_emotions.py** with the unseen images from *Predict* folder.
Input a face image and the prediction will be a corresponding emotion.
Dataset needs to be increased for better accuracy.
